    I use ajax for some feature, hence make sure to get node_module package in the main folder and in the java script folder (final_project/static/style/js/node_modules)

***Model :*** <br>
    Don't forget to create a model directory or folder in final_project/static/file/model.
    Our model later will be saved in that directory.
